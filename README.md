    if not length:
        length = random.randint(16, 20)
    else:
        length = int(length)

    char_pool = ""
    if upper_var.get():
        char_pool += string.ascii_uppercase
    if lower_var.get():
        char_pool += string.ascii_lowercase
    if digits_var.get():
        char_pool += string.digits
    if special_var.get():
        char_pool += string.punctuation

    if not char_pool:
        messagebox.showerror(translations[language]["error_title"], translations[language]["error_message"])
        return

    password = ''.join(random.choice(char_pool) for _ in range(length))
    password_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
    password_entry.insert(0, password)
